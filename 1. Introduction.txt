-> A GIT repository(.git folder) is a folder that is managed by GIT. 

-> The Git repository itself is divided into two parts : the first part is called the “index”, and the second part is what we will refer to as 
   the “object database”.

-> GIT commands(git) and sub-commands(add, commit etc) are always lowercase.
