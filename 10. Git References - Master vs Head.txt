-> Git References : pointers to commit Ids

-> References are stored in '.git/refs' directory.

-> 'master' is name of the branch.

-> HEAD is a Symbolic reference. If a reference points to another reference, then that reference is referred to as Symbolic reference.

-> By default, HEAD always points to branch name(latest commit).

-> HEAD can also point to another commit other than the latest one. In such cases, it is referred to as 'Detached HEAD'.

-> master info : .git/refs/heads/master

-> HEAD info : .git/HEAD
