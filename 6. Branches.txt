-> Branches allow to keep changes completely independent of one another.

-> Git by default uses a branch called "master".

-> We can't have "space" in branch name. However, hyphens, underscores and / are allowed.

-> A branch always points to the last commit on that branch, which in turn points to its parent, and so on and so forth.

-> A branch is simply a reference to a commit via its ID. This reference is updated every time we make another commit on that branch.

-> Every time we switch branches, Git rewrites working directory to look like it did when we made the most recent commit on the branch we just switched to.
