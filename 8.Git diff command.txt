-> By default, running 'git diff' in a repository compares the version that Git has in its 'index' with the version of the file in the 
   working directory.

-> 'git diff' displays only the parts of the file that have changed(hunks).

-> The git diff command is always comparing two sets of changes, that can be visualized by a venn diagram. The first argument is the set 
   on the left (always indicated by“a/”) and prefixed with a minus (“-”). The second argument is the set of the right, indicated by“b/”, 
   and prefixed with a“+”.
