* Syntax : git merge <arguments>

* Fast-forward Merge : In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without 
  creating an extra merge commit.

* When we merge the two branches together, we are attempting to combine the work done after the common commit.    

* A merge commit, on the other hand, has two parents : the first parent is the last commit on the branch that made the proposal 
  (integration branch or main branch), and the second parent is the last commit from the “proposee” branch that was merged in.
  Merge commits present a point in commit history where diverged branches come together.

* Merge conflicts result when we attempt to bring together commits that affect the same files in different ways.


-> git merge <branch_name> : merges the specified branch into the current branch
