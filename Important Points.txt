-> Git commit is a two-step process : git add & git commit. The Git repository itself is divided into two parts : the first part is called the 
   “index”, and the second part is what we will refer to as the “object database”. When we run 'git add <filename>' Git makes a copy of the file, 
   and puts it in the index. We can think of the index as the “staging area”, wherein we can put things till we are sure we want to commit to 
   them. Now when we run git commit takes the contents of the staging area and stores those in the object database, a.k.a Git’s memory bank.

-> A file that Git has never seen before (that is, a file that has never been added to the index) is marked as “Untracked”.

-> Any file that Git is watching for us is referred to as a “tracked” file.
